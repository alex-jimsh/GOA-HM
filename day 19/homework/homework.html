        <p class='my_p'>Little is known about Aristotle's life. He was born in the city of Stagira in northern Greece<br>
             during the Classical period. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child,<br>
             and he was brought up by a guardian. At 17 or 18, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and<br>
             remained there until the age of 37 (c. 347 BC). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens<br>
             and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored his son Alexander the Great beginning<br>
             in 343 BC. He established a library in the Lyceum, which helped him to produce many of his<br>
             hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls.</p>
