    <p class='my_p'>Until the age of 16, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. In 335 BC, shortly after his<br>
     assumption of kingship over Macedon, he campaigned in the Balkans and reasserted<br>
     control over Thrace and parts of Illyria before marching on the city of Thebes, which was<br>
    subsequently destroyed in battle. Alexander then led the League of Corinth, and used<br>
     his authority to launch the pan-Hellenic project envisaged by his father, assuming<br>
    leadership over all Greeks in their conquest of Persia</p>
