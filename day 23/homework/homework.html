<p id ='intro'>hello, this is my web and today we are just going to exit cause i dont know what <br>
else to do. sorry</p>

<p id="hi">hello again i am alex and this is my web we dont do anything here just this enjoy</p>

<p id="goodbye">i dont know if u enjoyed any of this but yeah bye!!</p>

<p id="yo">yo i just found out i have to make 5 of these </p>

<p id="end">yep this is the fifth one bye for real!! </p>



<!-- for example right here we used our dear # for selection method 
 by giving our <p> id's then later chosing the spesific color for all of it
if we didnot give id in css up we would end up by all <p> paragrahps
changing and that doesnot work out well cause in later run if u change your mind
u will have to give ids after ur whole code is done and add css and blah blah blah
well thats basically it bye-->
