<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>Well  html is basiclly start up for ur website without it nothing would be possible but its really<br>
<i>blend and boring</i> most u can do for so called <b>Desing</b> is make it <strong>Strong</strong> and make it <u>underline</u><br>
still pretty boring bhooo</p>
<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>well its for desings mostly and make your website look more proffesional and not like some<br>
<i>90 website</i> about world ending in <b>2012</b> and all that stupid stuff cause now its <b>2024</b>
that<br>why your probably not gonna read allat cause if u are just <b><u>WHY?</u></b> Well yeah css is like a<br>
desing for colors shadows and all that.</p>
<h4>JAVASCRIPT</h4>
